ABSTRACT 

Experimental and analytical studies have been 
carried out to characterize and further understand 
arcing phenomena with particular emphasis on erosion 
produced by arcs populating high-voltage (open) 
interelectrode gaps. 

This paper presents a set of related studies, 
each address a specific aspect of the arcing 
phenomena. First, bench top experiments were 
conducted to examine arcing behavior in a magnetic 
field as the arcs moved among bare and slagged 
electrodes. Direct observation of arcing in an HHD 
generator was then made on the Mark VII channel 

- sidewall, and these results were correlated with
measured voltage distributions.

Arcing erosion was measured in both the bench 
top and generator experiments for various electrode 
configurations. Erosion of copper electrodes was 
compared to erosion rates calculated from a thennal 
ablation model for stationary and/or moving arcs. 

Finally, a discussion is presented on some 
specific features of the arc behavior and on 
consequences of cathodic arcing. 

INTRODUCTION 

The lifetime of an MHD channel is limited by 
the gradual deterioration and/or catastrophic damage 
due to arcing, primarily on the cathode wall. 
cathode wall non-uniformities can lead to axial 
breakdowns both over the high-voltage intercathode 
gaps and across the sidewall insulator gaps. The 
erosion induced by these arcs can be reduced or 
tolerated in a number of ways: 

o Decrease the Hall field strength

• Generate more uniform axial voltage
distributions

• Lower the current density or increase arc
root mobility over electrode surfaces

• Select materials able to withstand high
arc thermal fluxes and/or electrochemical
erosion

• Use "sacrificial" or renewable electrodes

Some of these methods will degrade generator 
performance or will necessitate impractical 
designs. Others have not yet been tried. 

This paper, while not attempting to solve the 
arcing problem, provides additional insight into the 
multi-faceted arcing phenomena. Experimental 
observations and measurements as well as analytical 
studies will consider the following subjects: 

• Anode and cathode arcing features in
laboratory bench tests

o Voltage distributions and arc
characteristics in an MHD generator

• Electrode erosion by stationary and moving
arcs predicted by an analytical model

BENCH ARCING EXPERIMENTS 

Bench-scale experiments were conducted to 
simulate and observe the salient features of 
interelectrode arcing even though some features, 
such as adequate combustion gas flow over the 
surface and a moving slag layer, proved difficult to 
duplicate. These experiments first investigated arc 
damage to interanode insulators, then studied arcing 
behavior on the cathode wall both with and without 
slag. 

Arcing and Damage to Interanode Insulators 

Interanode breakdown and subsequent arcing is 
severely damaging because the J x B forces drive the 
arcs into the wall and the supporting backwall. The 
electrical properties of such arcs are described in 
Refs. (1) and (2), while experimental observations 
of interanode arcing in a generator were made in 
Ref. (3). Refs. (4) and (5) confirm that interanode 
insulator damage may be reduced by changing anode 
geometry. 

This experimental study focused on character­
izing interanode arcing in a magnetic field and 
reducing the possibility of damage by arc quench­
ing. The test rig shown in Figure l was used, where 
the insulators consisted of BN or Si3N4, 25 rrm x
15 mm in cross-section and 1-10 mm thick, clamped 
between water-cooled copper electrodes. The arc 
current was provided by a 300 V, 40 A rectifier, and 
a water-cooled Helmholtz pair provided magnetic 
field strengths up to 1.45 T. After the arc was 
initiated with a high frequency starter, inter­
electrode arc currents and voltages were recorded 
(Figure 2). The insulators were weighed upon 
completion of the test to measure the mass of 
evaporated material. For this series of tests, the 
burn time was 4-8 sec, the arc voltage was 80-120 V, 
and the mass loss was 40-400 mg. Data from a 
typical test series is shown in Table 1. From these 
experiments, the following observations were made: 

e Energy expenditure for BN arc "cutting
n is 

about l J/mg, independent of the magnetic 
field strength. For a gap current above
some minimum value Icr• which is a
function of magnetic field strength, this 
energy increases with current. 

• The cutting rate of BN is about 5 nm/sec
and decreases slightly as specific arc
power (power/gap thickness) increases.

• As the insulator thickness increases the
specific power remains constant while the
specific energy for ablation decreases,
indicating that arc power is more
efficiently utilized.

• Hot pressed silicon nitride plates were
more easily cut by arcing than the boron
nitride ones. Since both specific energy



l 

and spec ific power were lower for 
S13N4, the thermal (arc) ablation 
rate for these materials does not 
correlate to erosion/corrosion resistance 
or hardness. in which Si3N4 is 
superior to BN. 

To prevent propagation of an arc that has been 
driven into an insulator by the magnetic force. the 
arc must be ext inguished somewhere along its 
trajectory. One possible techniQue may be adapted 
from magnetic blast switch technology: Quenching an 
arc by blowing it into a chamber where interelec­
trode spacing abruptly increases. 

Experiments were performed using BN spacers, 
with an 8 nm wide cavity formed by machining the 
sides of two adjacent electrodes. Arcs were 
observed to initiate normally, but then disappear 
after reaching the edges of the cavity and cutting 
through the top of the insulator (Figure 3). The 
width itself of the c avity could not account for the 
arc quenching since the open circuit voltage was 
high enough to sustain the arc. Instead, it is 
concluded that the sudden increase in width 
extinguished the arc. It is then important to 
determine whether repeated arc ing would eventually 
cut through the remaining insulation to strike the 
back board. Such a break through did occur. but 
only after repeated arc initiations (7-15) at the 
same location with high voltages and currents. 
MkVII channel tests  support the possibility of 
limiting the depth of arc propagation: only about 1 
cm arc propagation was observed after 15 minutes 
when subjected to an externally applied 10-20 A 
interanode arc in a 2 T magnetic field. 

Slagged Intercathode Arcing 

The first series of intercathode bench top 
experiments studied arc breakdown in the presence of 
a molten slag layer. A seed/ash mixture was trans­
ported by argon through a gas-cooled enclosure over 
electrodes separated by a BN spacer. A magnetic 
field of up to 1 T was directed parallel to the 
length of the interelectrode gap. 

Figure 4 shows the time-resolved discharge 
current and voltage for various modes of operation. 
In the absence of a magnetic field, the 8-12 A arc 
burns quietly inside the "cavity" formed in the 
molten slag. The arc voltage is low due to metal 
vapor in the cavity. Dif fuse current transfer could 
also occur in thi s  mode, given the proper slag 
thickness and temperature. At higher currents the 
slag evaporates and the arc burns openly, surrounded 
by a s lag pool, at a low and stable voltage. 

The magnetic f ield was observed to exert a 
moderate influence on the current through the slag. 
At increasing field strengths. the voltage increased 
as the current channel was deflected to the top of 
the slag layer, elongating the current path. The 
influence of the magnetic field on an open arc, 
though, is quite strong. At higher magnetic fields 
with the s ame current, the voltage increases several 
times and periodic f luctuations of both current and 
voltage appear. The frequency ranges of these 
fluctuations fell around 1 and around 100 Hz. 
Molten s lag frequently forms "bridges" which reduce 
the voltage and a lso suppress the current fluctua­
tions. 

8.14-2 

The arc originates as a breakdown through the 
slag-filled gap, then expands radially toward the 
walls of the enclosure. Slag and a jet of plasma 
erupt noisily from the opening in the enclosure. 
The erratic nature of the arcing prevented any 
determination of current or magnetic field 
dependence. However, the heat flux to the 
electrodes increases greatly in the presence of a 
magnetic field, with about 70 percent of the total 
electrical energy transferred to the electrodes. 
The anode side of the intercathode arc receives a 
larger fraction of the total heat. 

Anodic erosion rates are significantly higher 
(Table 2) so that damage is concentrated on the 
anode edge. Platinum and tungsten-copper caps 
eroded somewhat less than the copper ones. The arc 
remains stationary for tens of seconds before chang­
ing positions. Therefore the electrode surfaces and 
anode edges wear rather unifonnly, and only averaged 
and smoothened arc traces could be observed in post­
test study. For example, traces on the platinum 
surface are 200-400 l11ll wide and 10-20 11111 deep. 

Unslagged Intercathode Arcing 

During the second series of experiments, arcs 
were monitored between open unslagged electrodes in 
the device pictured in Figure 5. Water-cooled 
copper electrodes could be positioned at various 
angles with respect to the imposed magnetic field, 
and they were adjusted so that the Lorenz force drew 
the arc away from the surface. The channel environ­
ment was simulated by spreading a cesium seeded 
flame from an oxy-acetylene burner over the elec­
trodes. Electrical and heat flux measurements were 
taken along with optical spectra of the discharge. 
Arc development and movement were recorded with a 
movie camera. 

In the first group of tests, the electrodes 
were oriented parallel to the magnetic field. 
Figure 6 shows the development of individual arcs: 
the arc first spreads radially from the edges of the 
gap and fonns a semicircle in a well-defined verti­
cal plane. The arc roots slide over the elec­
trodes. Next, several concentric current channels 
may appear, each with its own el!ctrode spots. In 
the final phase these channels disappear sequen­
tially, leaving a short-lived luminous cloud. This 
behavior did not vary substantially over the test 
ranges of 0.02-0.10 T and 10-30 A. 

The movie camera was too slow (500 frames/sec, 
10-4 sec exposures) to capture all the details of 
the process, but instantaneous features can be
observed from the frame sequences. Nonnally �he
current goes to zero and the voltage goes to ,ts
open circuit level when the new arc does not start
before the original one extinguishes. In some 
cases, though, an arc will elongate to.reach a high
voltage, allowing a new arc to fo"!1 while the 
original one still burns. These simultaneous arcs
lead to higher lmin and lower Vmax· The 
lifetime of an individual arc is 5-10 mse�, and the
velocity of the arc column and arc spots 1s about 5
m/sec. Particulates from the erosion pro�ess 
sometimes emerge from the gaps at a veloc1ty of
20-10 m/sec. The presence of hot combustion gases
only decreases the amplitude of current pulsations
due to an increase in lmin and some increase in
final arc length. This relative insensitivity to
the combustion gases is to be expected because the



arc properties are defined by the metal vapor jets 
· that emerge from the arc spots. These jets have a 

much higher conductivity than even seeded combustion 
products. 

The erosion rate was comparable to the values 
for slagged electrodes. Again, this is to be 
expected since the erosion is primarily dependent on 
current and heat transfer in the arc rather than on 
the atmosphere and surface chemistry. The atmo­
sphere and chemistry, though, could influence the 
motion and residence time of the arc spots. As 
before, the anode erosion was higher than that of 
the cathode despite the synrnetrical arc propagation. 

Gradual changes in electrode orientation alter 
the arc behavior. Arc movement along the gap pre­
dominates, while regular radial expansion subsides. 
Current and voltage pulsations become erratic and 
have smaller amplitudes than before. Movie frames 
shown in Figure 7 where the magnetic field is per­
pendicular to the top of the electrode (simulating a 
sidewall) reveal only one or two arcs existing 
simultaneously. Starting near the middle of the 
gap, the arc elongates irregularly and moves in the 
direction of the Lorentz force. The arc roots may 
move partly along the edges (especially of the 
anode) and partly across the top surface at about 
2-6 m/sec. The arc appears to be anchored by the 
anode spot position, with the cathode spot moving
freely. It is unclear whether the arc spot motion 
is continuous or jumping. After the arc channel 
moves to its next position, luminous clouds produced 
either by plasma afterflow or continuing diffuse 
current remain visible for about 1 msec.* 

The gas flow around the arc gap was visualized 
by adding sodium and strong turbulence was 
observed. The arc generated turbulent convection 
only moderately increases the heat flux to the 
electrodes despite a significant increase in the arc
voltage. Most of the energy is dissipated to the 
surrounding atmosphere where it is moved away from 
the electrodes by "arc blow11 • 

Erosion rates with the arc moving along the 
interelectrode gap are the lowest compared to an arc 
burning in the absence of a magnetic field. To 
supplement weight loss measurements erosion rate 
comparisons were made by measuring the intensities 
of the copper emission lines. The Cul lines 
radiated by the stationary arc are an order of 
magnitude stronger than those radiated by moving 
arcs at the same current. Higher anode erosion 
rates could result from either higher heat fluxes or 
lower mobility of the anode spots. Arc spot 
mobility is a function of the surface conditions. 
In these experiments the surface of the copper 
anodes was oxidized while the cathode surface 
appeared to be cleaned by sputtering. The low 
con�u�tance o�ide film on the anode can restrict 
mobility and increase the residence time of the 
ano�e spots by delaying the start of anode spot 
m�tion after breakdown. Alternatively, the gas flow
field could blow the arc spot away from the cathode 
edge to reduce the erosion rate there. 

* The role of the glow discharge/residual current in
the arc reignition was studied quite recently in 
Ref. 10. 

8.14-3 

Comparing the bench test results with the KHO 
channel eror.ion data shows similar (0.5-1.0 ll9/C) 
erosion rate�. supporting the conclusion that �Pid 
movement of the interelectrode arcs produces 
comparatively little erosion of the cathode and 
sidewall element,. The c1rcs are driven by Lorentz 
forces. On the sidewall these forces result from 
the main component of the magnetic field; at the 
cathode a small (0.01-0.10 T) magnetic field exists 
perpendicular to the wal 1. either as  a component of 
the main field 1 ines if the wall is tilted by as 
little as lv or as a spacial inhomogenity in the 
magnetic field. 

HK VII SIDEWALL VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION AND 
ARCING OBSERVATIONS 

Sidewall Voltage Distribution 

Forty pegs on the left sidewall of the Mk VII
channel were instrumented with voltage transducers 
to resolve the axial (Vx) and transverse voltage 
distributions (Vy)- It was observed that 

• Vy "overshoots" are larger a t  the
colder wall, especially for copper 
anodes, with both slagged and unslagged

the axial voltages are nearly uniform. 
With a slag layer the same features are 
observed but they exhibit larger 
scatter. Close to the �node wall the 
axial voltage distribution becomes even 
more uni f onn. 

A two-dimensional voltage distrib�tion
reconstructed from the axial traverses is shown in 
Figure a. Vertical voltage differences (�Vy) are 
usually smaller than the corresponding axial voltage
differences (DVx>· The larges

Sidewall Arcing 

·A special viewing port (Figure 9) was
installed in the right sidewall to permit 
observation of arcing on the opposite wall. A 
2-in.-diameter, 2-ft-long electrically insulated
tube passes through the magnet bore. The diameter
of the tube limits the field of view to 4-6 sidewall
bars or pegs. The tube is gas purged, and gas
pressure pulses remove the slag and dust that
collect in it.

Jntecoeg Arcing and Sidewall Arc Radiation 

With no 8-field. interpeg arcing induced by an 
external power supply was observed for both clean 
and slagged sidewalls. In seeded flow and unslagged 
walls, a single 5-20 A arc burns rather steadily at 
50-80 V. The arc is swept along by the flow (Figure
10a), elongating until it breaks off and starts 
again at point A. With slag, the arc impedes the 
flow so that the slag separates around it and leaves 
a clean surface downstream (Figure 10b). About 60 
percent of the arc thermal energy or 100 to 200 W 
goes to the electrode, which is sufficient to 
evaporate approximately 0.5 g/sec of molten slag. 
At a typical slag f low velocity of 2 cm/sec, this 
rate of evaporation will clear a 2 mm x 5 nm strip. 

Optical spectra of sidewall arc radiation were 
taken (Figure 11) which revealed that, in addition 
to radiation from the hot gas flow, strong lines of 
copper (Cul) and calcium (Cal and Call) are 
present. The copper originates from peg erosion 
while the calcium appears from the slag vapors. The 
intensity ratios of the copper lines (Cu I 5105, cu
I 5153, and Cu I 5218) were used to derive the arc
column temperature. Using known transition proba­
bilities, the temperature was calculated as T = 6030
± 200 K. This  temperature was comparable to that of
an air-burning arc. In addition, comparison of the
radiation from an arc sustained by an external 
source and from a high cathode open gap arc in a
magnetic field could be used to evaluate the Hall
arc current, which is normally difficult to measure
directly. 

Interbar Arcing 

lnterbar voltages were measured and the arcing 
pattern was simultaneously photographed with a 
200-rrm lens for the bars seen through the optical 
window (31M, 318, 32M, and 328). Optical spectra 
were also taken with a f iberoptics-connected 
spectrometer.  No arcing was observed under nonnal 
operation when DV, measured between 31M and 328, was 
lower than 50 V. When DV was increased above so to
65 V by apply ing an external de voltage or by 
connecting bars to cathodes, arcing took place if 
the seeded gas conductivity exceeded 3 mho/m. Three
to six arcs with currents of 2-3 A each usually
occurred on unslagged bars. Sometimes these arcs
suddenly merged into one large arc with a power
supply limited current of 10-20 A. When DV crossed
the threshold voltage in slagged flow. a more stable
5-10 A arc formed. In some cases, though, a current
up to 10 A could flow without forming an observable
arc. It i s  possible that an arc was indeed present 
but was running within the slag layer. 

Motion pictures taken under the conditions 
indicated in F igures 17 and 18 prompted the 
following observations and measurements:

is a factor of 1.2 to 1.5 times DVx but
is not high enough for arc formation. 
Increasing ovd to 60-70 v with an 
external power supply, or by connecting 
to certain electrodes can induce arcing.

Above the voltage threshold, strong arc

and then increases to over 10 A for the
strong arc in 0.05-0.01 second.

Several small arc spots or 1 to 2 large 
spots exist permanently and move slowly 
(a few cm/sec) over the liquid slag 
surface. The spot polarity is difficult 
to identify, as is the position of the

these arcs originate from the neighboring
wall element or if they run between the
slag surface and the core plasma, where
diffuse current transfer takes place. It

More distinct arcs were observed when the
magnetic field was reversed. These arcs

ANALYTICAL ESTIMATE OF ARCING EROSION

In this section we calculate the erosion of

electrode material due to the heat load imposed at

the foot of either a moving or stationary arc. 
The

heat load can be calculated from the electrica� 
power dissipated at the arc root. This power 1s

equal to the near electrode arc voltage drop times
the arc current. For the case of the intercathod

e

high gap arc, the voltage drop is related to the 
local gap properties. Local gap properties are 
associated with the physical state of the gap and
include insulator width, slag thickness, slag 
chemistry, and wall temperature, among others. On

the other hand, the currents flowing across the 
intercathode high gap arcs are strong functions o

f

the overall generator operating parameters, such 
as 

channel loading, average plasma conductivity, and
 

magnetic field strength. The voltage is believed

not to scale with generator size, while the 
intercathode gap current will increase with
generator size.

The anodic and cathodic drops of the 
intercathode high gap are assumed in the present
analysis to be approximately 1/3 of the total high
gap voltage (the other 1/3 consumed in the arc 



column). so that for a 75V gap each drop amounts to
. 25V. we have also estimated the cathode wall axial 
current leakage to be about 20A for the AVCO MkVI 
generator. So we can use 500W as a typical number 
for the heat load of these intercathode high gap arc
roots. The arc is assumed to be described by a 
2-dimensional gaussian distribution of heat flux q 
(W/m2) with a total arc heat load Q (W) using the 
following equations:

where Qmax is the maximum heat flux at the arc
center and Rare = k,

112 is the characteristic 
arc radius. Assuming that the heat load of this arc 
is imposed on a semi-infinite electrode, approxi­
mating that the depth of the electrode in the z
direction is much larger than Rare, the time 
dependent temperature distribution may be 
found.11,12 If the arc is moving over the 
electrode surface at velocity V, the temperature at 
the center of the moving arc (r=O) as a function of 
time and depth coordinate (Zm) in the moving frame

denoting the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of

The erosion rate of a moving arc G (kg/sec) can then 
be stated as the simple relation:

can be substituted into the.temperature equation at

Therefore the followin� integral

which can be used to find the ero�ion rate G as a

Note that the unknown G appears both inside
and outside the integral. This solution, though,
breaks down at small velocities where the erosion 
rate, defined in Eq. 4, approaches zero. Since 
actual erosion rates for stationary arcs are much 
larger than those for large arcs, an alternate 
solution must be obtained for the motionless arc. 
The ref ore the stationary a re erosion rate is defined
as:

The erosion rate now depends on the time 
derivative of the evaporation depth Zevap 
evaluated at time tevap, which is the time needed 
for the electrode surface under the stationary arc 
to reach the evaporation point. Inserting this new 
equation into the previous temperature equation with 
V00, results in the following integro-differential

The evaporation time is simple to obtain in 
closed form by setting Zevap=dZevap/dt=O and 
integrating the previous equation. Both equations 
were also solved numerically over a range of arc 
radii for a copper e 1 ectrode and an arc heat load of 
500 W. A "blended" solution for G(V, Rarc> has 
been constructed using the stationary erosion rate 
at small velocities and the moving arc solution for 
medium to large arc velocities. The results are 
shown in Figure 1 4 for an arc radius of 0.2 nm. 
From the solution it was found that there exists for 
every arc radius a critical arc velocity, denoted as 
V*, above which no erosion occurs. For the 0.2 ll11l 
arc investigated, this critical velocity is 0.8 
m/sec. 

A characteristic erosion rate has been defined 
as the erosion rate for an arc velocity that is half 
of the critical velocity; that is, G*=G(V*/2). For 
the test case shown in Figure 14, G*=2.5 mg/sec. 
The functional dependence of G(V) can be investi­
gated for all Rare once the arc velocity is 
nondimensionalized by V* and the erosion rate is 
nondimensionalized by G*. The curves of V*(Rarc> 
and G*(Rarc> in Figure 1 5 show that both critical 
velocity and characteristic erosion decrease with 



arc radius. In addition, a critical arc radius, 
·Rare*, exists beyond which no erosion occurs, even
for a stationary arc. This critical radius is
calculated as .25 mn for 500 W arcs on copper
electrodes.

A simplified set of equations are presented to
simulate the erosion rate for 500 W copper arcs as a
function of the radius :

3-dimensional plot of Gas a function of arc 
velocity and arc radius to critical radius ratio, 
constructed from the simplified equations, is shown 
in Figure 16. A similar 3-D description of arcing 
erosion might be developed by consolidating the 
effect of electrode material and arc heat load into 
the critical arc radius. 

Figure 16 shows the region for the arc radius 
very cose to the critical radius. This was done 
since typical characteristic erosion rates for 20A 
arcs from the model's results are around 500 
11g/coulomb (at Rarc/R:rc -0.5). Measured 
levels for arcing erosion in bench experiments yield 
much smaller numbers - 2 µg/coul. This rate can be 
attained by either of 2 situations: a) motionless 
arcs with radius very close to the critical radius 
which is the case described in Fig. 21, b) arcs of• 
arbitrary radius (smaller than R:rc> which move 
at velocities very close to the arc critical 
velocity. Of course the second criterion can be 
explained by arcs which are most of the time mobile 
w1th arbitrarily large velocities (larger than 
V ), but for a small fraction of their time are 
stationary, and erode the electrode at  this small 
time fraction. In this case it would mean that 
typically arcs are station�ry less than 1 percent of 
the time. 

DISCUSSION OF CATHODIC ARCING FEATURES 

Although arcing takes place on both the 
cathode and anode walls, erosion of the anode wall 
is less severe since the lower interelectrode 
voltage •spikes n infrequently produce arcing. Even 
if arcing does occur, proper design of the inter­
electrode space can limit the damage. Therefore it 
is more crucial to develop a broad understanding of 
•cathodic" arcing, including near-cathode sidewall
elements where the voltage distribution and arcing
breakdown conditions are similar to those of the
cathode. This similarity arises from both the 
sidewall/cathode electrical link and the formation 
of a potassium sub-layer over the sidewall following 
this link. Although propagation of the sidewall arc 
in the boundary l ayer and the velocity  of the arc 
root may be different from those at the cathode, 
sidewall erosion is probably not qualitatively 
different from cathode erosion. The ability of the 
"finer• sidewall s egmentation to split leakage 
current into multiple smaller arcs may be offset by 
these smaller elements being more susceptible to 
damage.

Figure 17 illustrates the formation of charac­
teristic •cathode• voltage patterns and arcing for a 
10 electrode wall segment. The voltage over the 
segment depends on the overall channel conditions. 
so it was necessary to assume some typical volt­
ages: 80 V arcing breakdown voltage. 70 V 
steady-state arc voltage, and l V voltage drop 
across a shorted gap. The latter voltage was 
selected for illustrative purposes since the actual 
voltage drop is quite small. The voltage distri­
bution and arcing sequence is thus: 

1. Initially the slag layer has uniform
resistance so that the gap voltages are all

equal.

The voltage is redistributed by the random
formation of the potassium-rich slag layer.
which changes selective gap resistances.

As this redistribution continues. most gap
resistances decrease with the available
voltage •concentrating" over the few
•unshorted• gaps.

As gap 02 gradually shorts. the voltage at 
gap 07 reaches breakdown level. 

An arc forms at gap 07 and runs along the 
gap length. carrying 70 V and a current w�ich. 
is a function of the overall channel cond1-
tions. The arc removes the potassium sub­
layer (one traverse of a 100 to 500 W arc is 
sufficient). but liquid slag continues to flow 
over the gap. except near the arc where arc 
jetting blows the slag away. The liquid slag 
across the gap has a relatively high resist­
ance and therefore does not short the gap. 

The arc extinguishes but the gap still remains 
highly resistive. It is unclear whether the 
gap voltage then remains the same or decreases. 

Gap 02 and gap 07 are now both highly
resistant but "arc-less" and the first one to
reach breakdown voltage. in this case gap 
#2, arcs. Thus the voltage in gap #7 
drops. 

Gap 02 arcs for a period of time. 

The arc across gap #2 disappears so that gap 
02 competes with the gap with the "next 
highest resistance". in this case gap 09. 

Gap 12 wins again. After a new breakdown. 
the arc on gap 02 re-establishes. 

Some features of this process merit further 
conrnents: 

si n g 1 e vs. Mu 1 t i p  1 e A r c s  

The arc mode depends on the shape of the V-1 
characteristics. In most cases the "minimum 
voltage• principle is valid for arc discharges and 
implies that the merger of small arcs should take 
place when operating on the falling branch of the 
v-I characteristic and not on the rising branch. 
The branch on which the arc operates is dependent on 
the operating conditions as follows: 

---



Falling Branch 

Free-burning arc 
High concentration of 
metal vapors in arc 
channel 
Strong conductivity 
rise with temperature 

Rising Branch 

Arc channel 
diameter limited
by walls 
Cold gas flow
Sma 11 inter-
e 1 ectrode distance
Weak conductivity 
rise with 
temperature

Consequently, arcs with high current (over a 
few A) that evaporate electrode material, slag, 
and/or seed deposits belong to the first category 
and tend to run asoloa. In contrast, low current 
"non-evaporatinga arcs whose small diameter is 
controlled by the acoldagas flow in the boundary 
layer belong to the second category and may exist as 
a several-member afamilya. These arcs include those 
between the core plasma flow and the electrode 
surfaces. 

Several strong arcs may coexist, but they must 
have separate power supplies to keep their roots 
electrically isolated in order to maintain them 
simultaneously. 

A r c M o v e m e n t 

Arc movement over an electrode surface is a 
function of the magnetic field (strength and 
direction), the electrode material properties which 
control the surface temperature, and the presence of 
an insulating oxide layer, a conductive seed/­
potassium layer, and the slag. To a lesser extent, 
the arc movement is also dependent on the tempera­
ture and electrical conductivity of the gas boundary 
layer. Arc velocity over very clean copper elec­
trodes has· been defined in Ref. 9 as v = 5 90.6 
(I/d)0.4. 

High current "evaporatinga arcs tend to stay a 
site which is hot or is covered with a conductive 
layer or to move along the gap ain search of• 
potassium deposits. These arcs tend to evaporate as 
much low-ionization potential material as possible 
into their current channels to lower their resis­
tances. Low current arcs do not incorporate 
electrode material and are therefore less surface 
dependent and more mobile. Since electromagnetic 
force is current dependent, the correlation of 
actual arc velocity versus current may be much more 
complicated. 

A r c i n g E r o s i o n 

Bench tests indicate that the erosion rate for 
a typical 20 A moving arc is on the order of 2 
µg,fC, which on the average is 0.05 mg/sec. 
Assuming that the removal of 10 g copper -can be 
tolerated, the electrode would have a lifetime on 
the order of 100 hr at this erosion rate. This 
prediction is somewhat pessimistic compared to 
better results obtained in long duration channel 
tests. Actual arcing erosion may also be reduced by 
several factors:

The open gap moves along the channel 

The effective duration of the arc is 
reduced by spending part of the time 
transferring current in the diffuse mode.
