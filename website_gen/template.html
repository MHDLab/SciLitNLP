This page is a programatically generated report of the results of topic modeling algorithms on a collection of scientific literature. Expand the sections below for more information. The code can be found on <a href=https://github.com/MHDLab/SciLitNLP>GitHub</a>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> <u>Dataset:</u> <b>{{ n_papers }}</b> papers that were found in the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus containing the regular expression <b>'{{ regex }}'</b> in the abstract or title</button>

        <p>
            The dataset used in this work is the <a href=https://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus>Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus</a>.
            The full dataset includes the paper metadata (title, abstract, citation info, etc. ) for over 25 million papers stored locally in a ~100 Gb sqlite database. Topic modeling is performed on a subset of this data that is obtained by finding papers that contain the regular expression <b>'{{ regex }}'</b> in the title or abstract.
            <!-- The dataset includes topic tags created by the now-defunct Microsoft Academic, and for the moment the dataset is first downselected to not include papers solely categorized as 'Medicine' (as they make up a large fraction of all research papers) -->

        <p>
            Topic modeling refers to machine learning algorithms that find collections of words that describe a corpus (collection of documents). 
            The topic modeling is performed with either a <a href=https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic>Correlation Explanation (CorEx) topic model</a> or a <a href=https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html>Gensim Latent Dirichlet Allocaiton (LDA)</a> topic model.

            <figcaption style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">A schematic of a general topic modeling agorithm where each word and document has some probability of being associated with a topic. One caveat is that for CorEx topic models, each word only belongs to one topic. </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </center>

        <p>
          Below is a plot of some different topics extracted from the corpus and their relative probabilities over time. The most probable words of the topic are shown above each figure. These words showcase the text processing that combines different variations on a word (i.e. strategy, strategic) into one root 'stem'. 
          The probability is calculated for each year by summing the given topic's probability over each paper, then normalizing so the sum of all topic probabilites for that year is 1.

        Each node represents a topic and each edge between two topics represents the likelihood of the two topics appearing in an abstract together.
        The graph projection is designed to make it easier to see connections between nodes.  The axes do not communicate additional information

        <br>
        <b>NODE COLOR:</b> community assigned by the Louvain community detection algorithm.<br>
        <b>NODE SIZE:</b> overall probability of the topic appearing in abstracts.<br>
        <b>NODE OPACITY:</b> probability of the topic appearing in abstracts over the past 5 years (brighter = higher probability).<br>
        <b>EDGE THICKNESS:</b> probability of two topics occurring in the same abstract.<br>

          <li>Click in the blank area to reset the selection to nothing</li>
          <li>With one topic selected, select another connected node to view the papers and words with the highest probabilities in both topics. Note that the words in CorEx topic models belong to only one topic, so there is no implemented method of finding the words associated with both topics. </li>
